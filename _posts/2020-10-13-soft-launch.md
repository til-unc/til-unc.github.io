This first blog post serves a gentle little announcement of the formation of Translational Immunogenonmics Lab (TIL) at UNC Chapel Hill by [Alex Rubinsteyn](http://rubinsteyn.web.unc.edu/), [Ben Vincent](https://unclineberger.org/vincent/), and [Jared Weiss](https://unclineberger.org/directory/jared-weiss/).  We're banding together to create the next generation of personalized cancer vaccines and other immune-directed therapies where computational and experimental research flows quickly into clinical trials. Ben and Jared have worked together at UNC, including on the [PANDA-VAC](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04266730) neoantigen vaccine trial. Alex is a newcomer to UNC from Mount Sinai, where he started the [OpenVax](https://www.openvax.org/) and worked on the [PGV](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29403468/) series of neoantigen vaccine trials. One of our current projects is to optimize the antigen/adjuvant formulation of defined epitope [SARS-CoV-2 vaccines](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.135004v1) and to use insights gained from those experiments to improve the immunogenicity of peptide based cancer vaccines. We are also soon going to hire into several research positions, which will be announced on this site. In the long run, we are hoping to create a closed loop between the computational, experimental, and clinical domains. Experimental results are used to train or validate computational models. These models are then used to personalize treatment in clinical trials. Observations and outcomes from clinical trials will then guide further experiments.
